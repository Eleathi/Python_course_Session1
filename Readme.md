# IMPRS Git demo

this is just a demo.
this is a new line

Create a file. and when you change it:

You use ctrl+s to save the file.
Then you go to source control and click the "+" button to stage the file.
And next, we need to type a message about what you changed and click "commit"
And finaly, to update to the GitHub online repository, we click "sync changes"

Tada:

now our repository can synchronise with a remote!
