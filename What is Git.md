GIT is a version management tool. 
you can use filenames to keep track of versions, multiple files etc. 
but if you make changes in a linked document, you need to continually update all thoses as well. 
this can be complicated.

GIT keeps track of your versions for you, and allows you to track changes and revert to older working versions.

you can get clean overview of changes, decide which files to add to your project, decide when to commit your changes.
it's always possible to convert to an earlier (committed) state of the project

> you can synchronyise it, which makes it easy to share your projects.
you synchronise it with a remote repository.
Remote means that it's on someone else's computer.
synchronising then just means that you upload/download the stuff from the server.

!! do not use Github to share privacy sensitive data !!

Repository: (working) directory with files, including their version history. 
to add to your project: you first add it to the 'staging area' and when you're happy, you 'commit' those changes.
